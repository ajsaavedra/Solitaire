# Solitaire

This is a recreation of the game of Solitaire done entirely in Java. Like many Solitaire games, users can stack cards on top of another
if the cards are of opposite color and if the new card being laid down is exactly of one less value.

In this GUI, users can start a new game at any time, or restart their current game if they think they can do better.
